# Signals overview

The follow table lists all signals used as main communication
channel throughout the project.

| Internal ID | Name | description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| 0 | ST_NONE | can be used as a null output or input. Guaranteed to stay at RCSIGNAL_NEUTRAL |
| 1 | ST_YAW | Steering / Rudder / Yaw signal |
| 2 | ST_THROTTLE | overall throttle |
| 3 | ST_THROTTLE_RIGHT | for tracked vehicles, this is the trottle for the left track. |
| 4 | ST_THROTTLE_LEFT | for tracked vehicles, this is the trottle for the left track. |
| 5 | ST_ROLL | Roll signal |
| 6 | ST_PITCH | Pitch signal |
| 7 | ST_SPEED | ProcEngineGear can use it as input and creates it also as output. Max speed is max RPM on the highest gear. So half speed signal means half maximum speed. |
| 8 | ST_AUX1 | Signal without special meaning. Can be freely used. |
| 9 | ST_AUX2 | Signal without special meaning. Can be freely used. |
| 10 | ST_IGNITION | Positive signal will start the engine. |
| 11 | ST_BRAKE | Positive signal will slow down the vehicle simulation |
| 12 | ST_GEAR | The current selected gear, 0 meaning neutral gear. -1 is the first rear-gear. |
| 13 | ST_TRAILER_SWITCH | Trailer switch (meaning trailer is connected) |
| 14 | ST_VCC | Battery input voltage in 100th Volt |
| 15 | ST_TEMP1 | Temperature sensor 1 (if available) in C |
| 16 | ST_TEMP2 | Temperature sensor 2 (if available) in C |
| 17 | ST_ENGINE_LOAD | Additional engine load in kW. This will be substracted from the engine energy. Note: it's in kilo Watts! |
| 18 | ST_RPM | Engine RPM in revolutions per min (only positive) |
| 19 | ST_LI_INDICATOR_LEFT | Left turn indicator input |
| 20 | ST_LI_INDICATOR_RIGHT | Right turn indicator input |
| 21 | ST_LI_HAZARD | A danger indication (left and right turn indicator) input |
| 22 | ST_FOG | Fog light (front and back) |
| 23 | ST_CABIN | Cabin light |
| 24 | ST_ROOF | Roof light |
| 25 | ST_BEACON | Beacon (flashing emergency) light input |
| 26 | ST_BEACON1 | Beacon (flashing emergency) light. Can be used as output |
| 27 | ST_BEACON2 | Beacon (flashing emergency) light. Can be used as output |
| 28 | ST_SIDE | Side light input (as in a trailer) |
| 29 | ST_HIGHBEAM | A highbeam front light. Usually generated by ProcAuto |
| 30 | ST_LOWBEAM | A lowbeam front light. Usually generated by ProcAuto |
| 31 | ST_TAIL | the red rear light output. Usually generated by ProcAuto |
| 32 | ST_INDICATOR_LEFT | Left turn indicator output |
| 33 | ST_INDICATOR_RIGHT | Right turn indicator output |
| 34 | ST_REVERSING | The white reversing light. Usually generated by ProcAuto |
| 35 | ST_SHAKER | Shaker motor output |
| 36 | ST_MASTER_VOLUME | The master volume. Audio output will apply this. |
| 37 | ST_HORN | Honking signal. |
| 38 | ST_SIREN | A siren signal such as in an ambulance. |
| 39 | ST_SHIFTING | Sound output shifting. Generated by ProcAuto. |
| 40 | ST_GUN | True if a shot is triggered (e.g. tank cannon or MG) |
| 41 | ST_FAN | Sound volume for a fan (e.g. cooling fan). |
| 42 | ST_TURBO | Sound volume for a turbo and/or wastegate. |
| 43 | ST_PARKING_BRAKE | Signal for the parking brake sound. |
| 44 | ST_HYDRAULIC | Sound volume for the hydraulic fluid hissing. |
| 45 | ST_TRACK_RATTLE | Sounds from tracked vehicles (todo: train tracks?) |
| 46 | ST_BUCKET_RATTLE | bucket rattle sound if moved fast |
| 47 | ST_TIRES | Tires squeeling |
| 48 | ST_FUEL_EMPTY | Out of fuel sample |
| 49 | ST_WINCH | Winch signal.  |
| 50 | ST_COUPLER | coupler (5th. wheel) |
| 51 | ST_EX_BUCKET | Signal for bucket movement. This is not the absolute bucket position but instead the bucket movement. |
| 52 | ST_EX_DIPPER | Movement signal for excavator dipper arm. |
| 53 | ST_EX_BOOM | Movement signal for excavator boom. |
| 54 | ST_EX_SWING | Movement signal for excavator arm swing. |
